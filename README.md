# Embodied Interaction miniproject

## Welcome!

You can run the project locally by serving `.source/index.html`.

Also, it's best if you run it in chrome or in any recently updated browser, since it will need a fairly recent version of webgl and web audio. It will need internet connection to load the mediapipe task.
